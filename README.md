## React + Flask + Socket.io = Tic-Tac-Toe
* I built a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game using react for the frontend and flask for the backend.  Real time play is made possible using 
websockets, with the Socket.IO library for backend and frontend.
* I learned that react is super nice to use, and also just how lightweight flask can be, which is really nice.  I've used django before 
which is great for many things but the ease and elegance of flask is much better in my opinion.
* Nothing hasn't worked so far! It took me a while to realize that I couldn't just use the WebSocket standard browser class to connect
to the socket.io based server.
